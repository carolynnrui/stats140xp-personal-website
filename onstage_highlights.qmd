Although just a minor, theater and performance is a major part of Carolynn's life! It's hard to know her without knowing all of the other people she's has the pleasure of being. Just for fun, here are some of her favorite moments on the stage.

## Curtains -- December 2024

In *Curtains*, Carolynn played the character of Georgia Hendricks, one half of a song-writing duo with her ex-husband Aaron Fox. After the star of *Robbin' Hood the Musical* dies in a tragic accident (or did she?), Georgia steps into the role of leading lady, all while other members of the theater company start to mysteriously meet their ends. Carolynn's favorite part of this role was getting to play two different characters: a endlessly worried and unsure Georgia yearning for a resolution to her and Aaron's relationship, as well as the bold and brash Madam Marian, whose boundless confidence becomes clear in great numbers like "Thataway!"
