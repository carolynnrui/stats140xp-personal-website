Hi! I'm Carolynn Rui, a fourth-year UCLA student passionate about statistics, psychology and theater -- storytelling occurs in all facets of each of this focuses, whether the medium be through an analysis of the data, a study of the mental processes underlying a phenomena, or a song-and-dance routine.

Explore my website to find out more about the research projects Iâ€™ve worked on, my experiences in theater, and how I bridge the gap between data and human expression. Check out my projects, connect with me on GitHub & LinkedIn, or just say hi!
