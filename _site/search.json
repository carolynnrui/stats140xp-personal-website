After the star of Robbin’ Hood the Musical dies in a tragic accident (or did she?), Georgia steps into the role of leading lady, all while other members of the theater company start to mysteriously meet their ends. Carolynn’s favorite part of this role was getting to play two different characters: a endlessly worried and unsure Georgia yearning for a resolution to her and Aaron’s relationship, as well as the bold and brash Madam Marian, whose boundless confidence becomes clear in great numbers like “Thataway!”"

    "text": "Sunday in the Park with George – December 2023\nIn this surreal depiction of the life of famous painter Georges Seurat, Carolynn played the role of Yvonne, the pretentious, arty wife of the famed painter Jules. While George pioneers the esteemed pointillism technique he eventually integrates into renowned works such as A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, he fends off the ostentatious critiques of Jules and Yvonne. Carolynn’s favorite part of being in this show was the incredibly beautiful music, composed by the late-yet-great Stephen Sondheim, and getting to comprise a husband-wife duo with a dear and remarkably talented friend."

While the musical keeps most of the classic comedic elements from the original movie, such as the use of coconuts to mimic horses’ hooves and the killer rabbit, it also develops upon the character of the Lady of the Lake, who appears sporadically throughout the show to aid Arthur and his knights in their quest for the Holy Grail (or to remind the audience she’s the star). Carolynn’s favorite parts about this role was its challenging vocal demands and multitude of extravagant makeup and costume changes. It was a wonderfully pleasing role, both for the crowd and for the actor who had the delight of bringing it to life."
