She’s especially interested in how data and human behavior intersect in research, and currently volunteers as a finance associate for Hooligan Theater Company. When she’s not analyzing numbers, she’s probably singing, performing, or planning her next adventure with friends. On weekends, you’ll find her exploring new spots in LA, trying out fun activities, or just making great memories with the people around her. If you’re interested in her previous work and leadership experience, take a look at her resume!"

After the star of Robbin’ Hood the Musical dies in a tragic accident (or did she?), Georgia steps into the role of leading lady, all while other members of the theater company start to mysteriously meet their ends. Carolynn’s favorite part of this role was getting to play two different characters: a endlessly worried and unsure Georgia yearning for a resolution to her and Aaron’s relationship, as well as the bold and brash Madam Marian, whose boundless confidence becomes clear in great numbers like “Thataway!”"
